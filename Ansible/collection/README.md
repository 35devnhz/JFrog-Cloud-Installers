# ansible
This repo contains the Ansible collection for JFrog roles. These roles allow you to provision Artifactory for High-Availability using a Primary node and multiple Secondary nodes. Additionally, a Postgresql role is provided for installing an Artifactory Postgresql database.

## Roles Provided
### artifactory
The artifactory role installs the Artifactory Pro software onto the host. Per the Vars below, it will configure a node as primary or secondary. This role uses secondary roles artifactory-nginx and artifactory-java to install nginx and java dependencies.

### artifactory-nginx-ssl
The artifactory-nginx-ssl role installs and configures nginx for SSL.

### postgres
The postgres role will install Postgresql software and configure a database and user to support an Artifactory or Xray server.

### xray
The xray role will install Xray software onto the host. An Artifactory server and Postgress database is required.

## Example Inventory and Playbooks
Example playbooks are located in the [example-playbooks](example-playbooks) directory. This directory contains several example inventory and plaaybooks for different Artifactory, HA and Xray architectures.

## Executing a Playbook
```
ansible-playbook -i <hosts file> <playbook file>

eg.
 ansible-playbook -i example-playbooks/rt-xray-ha/hosts.yml example-playbooks/rt-xray-ha/playbook.yml
```

## Bastion Hosts
In many cases, you may want to run this Ansible collection through a Bastion host to provision JFrog servers. You can include the following Var for a host or group of hosts:

```
ansible_ssh_common_args: '-o ProxyCommand="ssh -i <private key location on bastion> -W %h:%p <bastion_user>@<bastion>"'

eg.
ansible_ssh_common_args: '-o ProxyCommand="ssh -i ~/.ssh/ansible-priv.pem -W %h:%p ubuntu@13.82.225.208"'
```

Ensure that you have the private key on the bastion host.
